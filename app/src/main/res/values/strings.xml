    <string name="quick_start_text_4">Use the Options Menu (Android 3.x and later) or Android menu button (Android 2.x and earlier) to navigate 
        to other screens.</string>
    <string name="quick_start_text_5">There will be two alerts for each coupon: one at 5 am on the date of expiration and

    <string name="detailed_directions_subtitle1">What this app does</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_text1">This app is for those of us who forget about their coupons 
        until after the expiration date.  The app is simple.  You add in the coupon details manually, 
        and the app will alert you twice about the coupon: once 2 days before it expires, and once on the day of expiration.  You 
        can edit the coupons after they’ve been saved, and you can delete them.\n\nWhile the app was intended specifically 
        for coupon reminders, it can be used to remind yourself about anything.\n</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_subtitle2">Caution</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_text2">If an alert comes while the device is off, it’ll only display once you turn the 
        device back on.  The app does not turn on the device.\n</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_subtitle3">App navigation</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_text3">On the front screen, select \"New Coupon\", \"View or Edit\" or \"Help\".  In the Help screens, 
        press back to return to the previous screen.  Otherwise use the Options Menu to navigate from screen to screen.  If using Android 
        2.x or earlier, the Menu button (typically at bottom) is pressed to access the Options Menu.\n</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_subtitle4">Alerts</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_text4">Alerts arrive at 5 am on the coupon’s expiration date and 5 am two days before 
        the expiration date.\n</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_subtitle5">In the future</string>
    <string name="detailed_directions_text5">If there’s enough interest, I’m thinking of creating a paid 
        (but still cheap, probably $0.99) version which allows you to choose how many alerts you want for a coupon, 
        when they come, and the ability to categorize and filter coupons.  Suggestions are welcomed.\n</string>
